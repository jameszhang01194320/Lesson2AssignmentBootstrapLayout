Lesson 2: Assignment | Bootstrap Layout

Task 1: Design the Services Section Use the grid system to design a services section that showcases at least three services offered by Tech Solutions. Each service should have an icon/image, a title, and a short description.
Expected Outcome: A well-structured services section with equally spaced service cards that stack vertically on smaller screens and display in a row on larger screens.

Task 2: About Section with Sidebar Design an 'About Us' section that includes a main content area and a sidebar. The main content should take up two-thirds of the width, while the sidebar occupies one-third.
Expected Outcome: An 'About Us' section that maintains a two-column layout on medium to large screens and collapses into a single column on smaller screens, ensuring readability and accessibility.

Task 3: Create a Contact Form End with a contact form that uses Bootstrap form components. The form should include fields for the user's name, email, a selection of the service they are interested in, and a message box.
Expected Outcome: A responsive contact form that is well aligned and aesthetically pleasing, with intuitive input fields that provide a seamless user experience across all devices.
